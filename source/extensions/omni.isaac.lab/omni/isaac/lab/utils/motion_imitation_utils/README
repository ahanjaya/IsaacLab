The code in this package comes from the original `motion_imitation` repository from Google Research. The code
here is used to deal with the motion data, and we are reusing it so we can keep the same format.
The code here is dependent on some PyBullet utilities but does not require a PyBullet instance. In the future
we could rewrite the transformations to be indenpendent from PyBullet to fully decouple it.
